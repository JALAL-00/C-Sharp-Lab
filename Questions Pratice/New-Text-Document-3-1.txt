Write a C# program for the following scenario:
Design a class named Person with properties for holding a person’s name, address, and telephone number. 
Next, design a class named Customer, which is derived from the Person class. The Customer class should 
have a property for a customer number and a Boolean property indicating whether the customer wishes to 
be on a mailing list. A retail store has a preferred customer plan where a customer can earn discounts on all 
purchases. The amount of a customer’s discount is determined by the amount of the customer's overall 
purchases in the store as follows: 
• When a preferred customer spends TK. 500, he or she gets 1 percent discount on future purchases.
• When a preferred customer spends TK. 1000, he or she gets 2 percent discount on future purchases.
• When a preferred customer spends TK. 1500, he or she gets 5 percent discount on future purchases.
• When a preferred customer spends TK. 2000, he or she gets 7 percent discount on future purchases.
Design a class named PreferredCustomer, which is derived from the Customer class. The 
PreferredCustomer class should have properties for the customer’s overall purchases and customer’s 
discount level.
The Main method is already given for you, try to write other classes to make it happen, write appropriate 
fields, methods, properties etc. Use proper access modifiers, types etc.


public class PreferredCustomerTest
{ static void Main(string[] args)
 { PreferredCustomer pc1 = new PreferredCustomer();
 pc1.Name = "RAHIM";
 pc1.Address = "Dhaka";
 pc1.Mobile = 123456789;
 pc1.MailingListPermission = true;
 pc1.TotalPurchase = 7000;
 Console.WriteLine(pc1.Name);
 Console.WriteLine(pc1.Address);
 Console.WriteLine(pc1.Mobile);
 Console.WriteLine(pc1.MailingListPermission);
 Console.WriteLine(pc1.TotalPurchase);
 Console.WriteLine(pc1.DscountLevel); 
 }}
